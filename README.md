Rich Web Applications Assignment


JustEat has contacted you to develop a mobile application that can be used taking orders. The company wants you to use the latest AJAX technologies during the implementation of the application to provide high quality interactions between the user and the application.

The company has said that they will use a range of different devices for accessing the application including iPads, mobile phones and laptops. jQuery mobile was selected as the framework that should be used for the development of the application.

They have not specified what user interface components that should be used for the application, leaving the overall design of the application up to you.
